- 👋 Hi, I’m @jordynbx. I'm a student in the Web Software Development program at Madison Area Technical College (MATC). The majority of my Github work is currently private due to the nature of school assignments and what is allowed to be publically visible. I'm looking forward to completing more independent projects on Github that show off my skills soon!
